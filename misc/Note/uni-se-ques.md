## Define functional and non functional requirements.

> Functional requirements

- These define what the system should do.

- Functional requirements specify the core functions and behavior of the system.

- A functional requirement defines what a system is supposed to do. It describes the
specific functionality, behavior, or tasks the system should perform to meet the user's needs.

- These requirements focus on the features and operations of the system.

> Non Functional requirements 

-  These define how the system should perform or other system constraints.

- Non-functional requirements specify the quality attributes of the system.

- A non-functional requirement (NFR) defines the quality attributes, performance, or
constraints of a software system rather than its specific behavior or functionality. It
describes how the system should operate and addresses areas like performance, security,
usability, reliability, scalability, and more.
